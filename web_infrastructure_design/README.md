## 🎯 Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:

### 🧠 General
- 🗺️ Draw a **diagram** covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects.
- 🧩 Explain what **each component** is doing.
- 🧱 Explain **system redundancy**.
- 🔤 Know all the mentioned acronyms:
  - 💡 **LAMP**
  - 🚫 **SPOF**
  - ⚡ **QPS**

## ✅ Requirements

### 📌 General
- 📄 A `README.md` file at the **root of the project** is mandatory.
- 🧰 For each task:
  - ✍️ After **whiteboarding** (whiteboard, paper, or software), take a **photo/screenshot** of your diagram.
  - 👀 This project will be **manually reviewed**.
  - ✅ As each task is completed, the task name will turn **green**.
  - ☁️ Upload a screenshot showing the required levels to an **image host** (e.g., Imgur).
  - 🔗 Insert the **link** to your screenshot in the **answer file**.
  - 🔄 After pushing your answer file to GitHub, add the **GitHub file link** in the **URL box**.
  - 🧑‍🏫 You will also **whiteboard each task live** in front of a mentor, staff, or student — *no computer or notes allowed*.
